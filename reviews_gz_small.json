It was very spacious and great for larger families or groups.  Checking into the place was done remotely so make sure your phone is charged when arriving at the place as we had to call our hosts when we arrived and they buzzed us in.  Unfortunately, I think I was allergic to something in the apartment as my eyes become itchy and watered when I was in the unit but cleared up when we went outside. Once I got allergy medicine from the pharmacy It helped me to enjoy my stay and we were out exploring the city most of the time.  Also, we were told and agreed upon a prompt 11 am check out time but were awoken at 8 am by the next guest entering the unit with keys...?  After a brief language barrier (she was Italian) we agreed to check out early since we were already up, while she left her luggage in the unit and left to give us our space/time.    The unit itself was clean and a great deal for the price/location.

But I think the worst part was that they actually told us when we did the check in and after we paid that we he to be extremely quiet during night (which wasn\u2019t in the house rules or anything) because if we did any noises the neighbors will call the police and if that happens we had to leave the apartment right away. There was actually a sign in the building lobby that said that if there was any inconvenient with the \u201ctourist apartment\u201d call the police.

Would recommend to anyone.": "Before I start my review, I just want to let you know that I am a long-standing Air BNBer with lots of positive reviews. I have generally had good experiences but this stay was not good.<br/>Firstly the property is not run by Mirea & Maria but by a property management company, Barcelona4Seasons. I point this out because a big draw for me to this property was that I would be dealing with members of the LGBTIQ+ community. It\u2019s worth noting this. Communications ahead of time were generally good and they were responsive. There was however a significant problem which led to my party abandoning the property.  <br/>The apartment is fantastically located in Sagrada Familia district. The apartment is an older apartment block and is definitely \u2018vintage\u2019. <br/> <br/>The problem is that there are significant building works going on to the rear of the apartment. These are major. They look like they have been there for some time and are likely to continue for several months. They create significant noise pollution which is heard throughout the apartment but specifically loudest at the rear of the building where 2 of the bedrooms are located. There is significant dust and debris produced by the building works also. <br/>This will have several impacts on your stay:<br/>- unless you are a deep sleeper you are likely to be woken during the day by the building works.<br/>- you will not be able to return to the apartment during the day as any rest you may wish to take will be impacted by the works.<br/>- you will be unable to leave the rear apartment windows open during the day because of the dust.<br/>I think therefore currently this would not make for a good holiday/tourist stay. It might be appropriate if you are staying for work.<br/>My friends who arrived first during the afternoon discovered this problem and refused to stay. They felt unsafe and, as this was part of their honeymoon, I don\u2019t blame them. They recorded good video footage which shows the extent of the building works and the noise pollution. I am happy to share this on request.<br/>I immediately reported this to Barcelona4Seasons on my arrival. They denied knowledge of this significant building project and were unable to offer a refund or to rehouse us. They stated that they were unaware of these works. I find this comment surprising given that cleaners are coming into the apartment regularly and the scale of work. We were therefore obliged to find alternative accomodation and I am actively pursuing a refund.<br/>My stay was on the8th September and am writing this on 24 th September. I have looked at the listing today and note that no mention is made of the property management company or the building works. I would have hoped to have been told about the building works ahead of my stay as this would have impacted my  choice to stay here. I hope this helps you make an informed choice ahead of your stay. <br/>I hope by the time you read this the omissions in the listing have been updated as this could have been a great spot to stay were it not for the conditions."}, {"18674": "269467", "4808211": "250228865", "2013-05-27": "2018-04-04", "4841196": "174041011", "Caron": "Luis", "Great location.

Walking is a big part of our vacation stay, so we didn't mind. We love discovering random shops along the way.

Also great window blinds/shutters if you need to block out the sunlight. Full equiped kitchen with everything you need. Only downside if I had to pick would be location, it is a bit out there by sagrada familia so it can be a bit of a trek if you gonna walk it from the beach or some bar in born. Either way I would recommend."}, {"18674": "269467", "4808211": "839008188606542745", "2013-05-27": "2023-03-03", "4841196": "494331848", "Caron": "Stella", "Great location. Clean, spacious flat.
